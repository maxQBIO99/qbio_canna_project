# R 
This folder contains the Rscript created for the RNA-seq analysis. <br>

All plots and files created can be found under the file "results". <br>
To use the RScript remember to start an RProject in the same folder where all the folders of the kallisto pseudomapping are saved in and to add the study design folder in there aswell.
